# this is my local repo
# to bring a repo from remote
use :- git remote add orign <-link->

we can use any other name rather using origin (but we onlly have to use tht only)
use git remote -v (use to verify remote)
"git branch" will tel on which branch we are on
to rename branch use "git branch -M <-newName->"

we can use "git push -u origin main"
by using "-u" we will set an upstrem matlb muje baaar origin main nhi link na hoga
